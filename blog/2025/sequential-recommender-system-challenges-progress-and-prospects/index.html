Challenge 1: Learning higher-order sequential dependencies : Dependency on large number of previous transactions for purchase order<br>b. Challenge 2: Learning long-term sequential dependencies : Dependency of current purchase on the previous items that are far from here.</li></ol> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*orAsT7ASU5Cwr9zQj2Xo8A.png"></figure> <p>In the above sequence,</p> <ul> <li>If we consider say n no. of previous purchase, it is n order sequential dependency.</li> <li>the dependency of rose on vase after 3 interactions or purchases is the long-term sequential dependency.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Existing Solutions:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Higher-order Markov Chain</li> <li>RNN</li> </ul> <p><strong>2. Handling user-item interaction sequences with a flexible order</strong></p> <ul> <li>In a shopping sequence = {milk, butter, flour},<br>- the order of buying the milk and butter doesn’t matter<br>- But the union of milk and butter leads to higher probability of buying the flour next.</li> <li>In the condition where there flexibility in the order of purchase, it is better to capture the <strong>collective sequential dependencies</strong> rather than <strong>point-wise dependencies</strong> </li> </ul> <p><strong>Existing Solutions:</strong></p> <ul><li>CNN-based SRSs.</li></ul> <p><strong>3. Handling user-item interaction sequences with noise</strong></p> <ul> <li>Some historical interactions are strongly relevant to the next interaction</li> <li>While, others may be weakly or even irrelevant</li> </ul> <p><strong>Existing Solutions:</strong></p> <ul><li>Attention models</li></ul> <p><strong>4. Handling user-item interaction sequences with heterogeneous relations</strong></p> <ul> <li>Other than sequential dependencies, there can also be similarity based relations between the interacted items in terms of their features.</li> <li>Hence another key challenges in building SRSs is how to effectively capture these heterogenouse relations embedded in the user-item interaction sequences respectively and to make them work collaboratively for the sequential recommendations.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Existing Solutions:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Mixture models are the only solution so far for this challenge</li> <li>The mixture model integrates different types of relations modelled by different sub-models to collaboratively generate the sequential recommendations.</li> </ul> <p>5. Handling user-item interaction sequences with hierarchical structures</p> <p>a. Hierarchical Relation 1: hierarchical structure between the metadata and user-item interactions. For ex: the user’s demographics can determine the users’ preferences in some degree.</p> <p>b. Hierarchical Relation 2: hierarchical structure between sub-sequences and user-item interactions.<br> i. In some SRSs, one user-item interaction sequence includes multiple sub-sequences(also called sessions). These historical sequences can affect the current purchase.</p> <p><strong>Existing solutions:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Hierarchical RNNs</li> <li>Hierarchical attention</li> </ul> <h3>Research Progress</h3> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*DPpfZ0rqJSI8hsk0UmRLVQ.png"></figure> <p>Reference: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04830" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04830</a></p> <p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=1a6c22551ea4" width="1" height="1" alt=""></p> </body></html>
