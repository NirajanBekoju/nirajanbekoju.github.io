As a Computer Engineer, I have an interest in linear
algebra, multi-variable calculus, probability, and statistics.
Currently, I am learning machine learning and deep learning and
studying CNNs, sequential models like RNNs, GRUs, and LSTMs. My
programming languages of interest are Python, C, C++, Octave and
Julia. I would love to explore Reinforcement Learning.

I have been working on nepali language processing to develop
              language model for sentimental classification, text auto -
              generation and summarization.

Other than technical aspects, I enjoy listening instumental
              music(mostly classical), playing flute, cycling, walking,
              meditation, and spending time without doing anything.I love
              studying history, religion and philosophy. As of now, my favorite
              anime are One piece and Attack on Titan.
