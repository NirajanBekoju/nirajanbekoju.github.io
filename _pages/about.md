I completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Engineering at Pulchowk Campus, Tribhuvan University.

I am passionate about machine learning and have working experience in `Anomaly Detection and Diagnosis`, `Time Series Analysis and Forecasting`, `Recommendation System`, NLP, `RAG`, and Chatbot development. With experience in these fields, I am always eager to dive deeper into emerging trends and technologies, continuously enhancing my skills in areas such as `Data Science`, `Big Data Analytics`, and `NLP`.

Other than technical aspects, I enjoy listening to instrumental music and spending time without doing anything. I love studying history, and philosophy. As of now, my favorite anime are One Piece and Attack on Titan.
